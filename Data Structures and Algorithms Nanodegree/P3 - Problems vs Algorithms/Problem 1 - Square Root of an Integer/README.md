# Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

I first started counting up from 1 multiplying each iteration by itself until the target was reached. I then realized it'd be more efficient to take an approach similar to a BST. 

Time Complexity: O(log(n))

Similar to searching a BST

Space Complexity: O(1)

Memory use is independent to the input. Each loop run is independent.
