# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

For this trie I decided to use a defaultDict to store the children which made for cleaner looking code.

## Find Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character needs to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(1)

No memory is allocated

## Insert Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character needs to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(n)

n characters need to be allocated

## Suffixes Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character needs to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(1)

No memory is allocated
