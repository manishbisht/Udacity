## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

###Part 1: Optimized PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:
* Moved analytics code at the bottom of the page.
* Moved all the styles on this page.
* Loading google font in more optimised way.
* Added media print seperately.
* Copressed and resized all images.
* Loading scripts asynchronously. 

- Click [here](https://manishbisht.me/Udacity/FrontEnd%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree/P4%20-Website%20Optimization/) to view the complete optimised page.
 
- Google PageSpeed Insights Desktop: 91/100 , Mobile : 90/100
 
###Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
